Notes on the io500 setup

1. io500 is run directly (without using a job scheduler) as follows:
./io500.sh config-full_FG_CS_Hint_extfind.ini # config with finegrainread/write and createsharing hints and with external find script


2. MPI hints are used for ior-hard-read, ior-hard-write, mdtest-hard-write using the following 'API =' lines defined in the io500 (config-full_FG_CS-EHW_Hint_extfind.ini) ini file, as shown below:

[ior-hard-write]
# The API to be used
API =  POSIX --posix.gpfs.finegrainwritesharing
 
[...]

[ior-hard-read]
# The API to be used
API =  POSIX --posix.gpfs.finegrainreadsharing

[...]

[mdtest-hard-write]
# The API to be used
API = POSIX --posix.gpfs.createsharing


3. For the 'Find' benchmark an external script is used as shown below:

[find]
# Set to an external script to perform the find phase
external-script = <full_path_specified>/find_script_stop.sh

Full details on the external find script are included in the find_script/ directory, which contains:
find_script_stop.sh  ssh_script.sh  stop_cont_io500.sh  track_io500.sh


4. mpich 4.1 used and following MPI_ROOT/PATH setup is enabled:
export MPI_ROOT=/nshare/pidsouza/mpich-4.1/install
export PATH=${MPI_ROOT}/bin:/usr/lpp/mmfs/bin:/home/mpich/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${MPI_ROOT}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


5.  io500.sh script sets the following MPI arguments and the hostfile defined below:
#mpiexe PATH set to mpich4.1 through above PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings
io500_mpiargs="-f /nshare/pidsouza/io500/monthly/io500_sc23/nodesib -n 200"

Hostfile:
arches1ib
arches2ib
arches3ib
arches4ib
arches5ib
arches6ib
arches7ib
arches9ib
arches10ib
arches14ib

6. During the io500 run, to disable inode prefetching during pfind phase 
"find_srcipt/track_io500.sh" is run in the background. In future implementation
we intend to handle this function by adding a hint to standard pfind or a custom pfind.
