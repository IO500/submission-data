io500_info_whatever="The storage cluster is a 42PB HDD cluster with a small SSD tier, connected to an Ethernet network fabric. The client machines used for the benchmark have an asymmetric up-/down-stream capacity. Benchmarks ran concurrently with production load. The benchmarks used a single volume, and utilized 3 out of 100 available metadata services. IOR easy ran against SAS-NL drives, the other benchmarks against SAS SSD drives. The IO500 benchmark was run by Quobyte Inc. in collaboration with STFC staff."
